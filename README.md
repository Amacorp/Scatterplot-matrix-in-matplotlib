In the field of Machine Learning, data visualization is not just making fancy graphics for reports; it is used extensively in day-to-day work for all phases of a project.

To start with, visual exploration of data is the first thing one tends to do when dealing with a new task. We do preliminary checks and analysis using graphics and tables to summarize the data and leave out the less important details. It is much more convenient for us, humans, to grasp the main points this way than by reading many lines of raw data. It is amazing how much insight can be gained from seemingly simple charts created with available visualization tools.
